You will also need to download a couple of heavy files which includes the pre-trained weights of YoloV3, the configuration file and the names file.
Weights and cfg (or configuration) files can be downloaded from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo. You will see a couple of different options available. The model has been trained for different sizes of images: 320 x 320 (high speed, less accuracy), 416 x 416 (moderate speed, moderate accuracy) and 608 x 608 (less speed, high accuracy). We will download the weights and cfg files for YOLOv3â€“320 for now.

Names file can be downloaded from https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names.
